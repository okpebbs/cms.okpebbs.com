# PARTY ANIMALS update

Well, it's been a while since I did an update on this project.

I've been really busy working at [NUEVA](https://nuevavenice.com/).
As well as rebranding, switching domains, building assets for YouTube projects, and mapping out my future as a photographer in the midst of the pandemic.

### 1. I re-branded.

I wanted something easier to spell/remember/speak aloud. I think "okpebbs" is the golden ticket.

### 2. I've been working full time in a fairly busy kitchen.

For those not aware, kitchen work is pretty draining, the pay sucks and it often comes without benefits.

### 3. I've been setting the stage to start shooting some big YouTube projects.

I'd elaborate on them further, but I figure it's better *done than said*.

### 4. I've been building an outdoor studio kit.

This will enable me to shoot all the photography projects at a safe "socially-distant" distance.

### 5. I've been working on another series.

It's just a big album at the moment, but I'm planning on adding context and turning it into a book at some point. You can view the link here: *[Cooks of Los Angeles](https://photos.okpebbs.com/Cooks-Of-Los-Angeles)*

### 6. I haven't "finished" edits on all the dogs, I shot in the park.

I quickly found that the shots I was getting were not up to my personal standards. I started looking for artists to commission artwork using the photos as a reference. I'm currently waiting on the artist to get back to me for progress pics. I'm planning on reopening the project in December 2020. Hopefully in time for Christmas.

### 7. I've been refining my workflow and testing outdoor portrait shooting.

I have a pretty high standard in terms of what I want for my photos. I like edge-to-edge sharpness for all my subjects. Normally something only plausible during certain times of the day or in a studio environment. So I've been working toward having a mix of both. Refining lighting patterns, composition, and getting authentic expressions from my subjects.

### 1. I did a really bad job of collecting user information.

In my attempt to avoid *over-collecting* user info, I collected *too little* to make shooting viable. I ended up with a bunch of phone numbers attached to pet's names for one list and a bunch of photos without pet names. Also, I didn't really have the means to keep up contact via my computer. Big oof.

### 2. I tried to canvas the city vs using one locale.

First of all, the park I chose, was *<bold>too poppin</bold>*. Way too many other dogs/distractions to get the shots I was looking for. And getting to other parks with all my equipment on a bike was a bit too much.

### 3. It was **waaay** too advantageous of an editing process for free.

Don't get me wrong, I love photography, pets, and meeting new people. It's just that my usual workflow doesn't involve photoshopping leashes, or cutting out backgrounds. While some of the shots I got were decent. Most were not up to my standard.

### 4. It wasn't viable to use my former roster of lenses.

I was going for close-up portraits along with a few environmental backgrounds. With that in mind, shooting an *animal* without the aid of autofocus whilst holding a flash unit was basically impossible. I needed to hold the flash in order to orient myself correctly. This issue has been remedied. I purchased a longer range autofocus lens to get the shots I'm looking for.

### 5. Some people were willing to pay/donate.

***I stupidly said "no."*** I was in the middle of a lot of things and wasn't certain of my ability to deliver as it was an entirely new shooting environment for me. I've set up venues for donations, and a *"Pay-What-You-Want"* option for scheduling.
