> 🎉 PARTY ANIMALS (free photoshoots)🐶🐱🐷. Hello neighbors!
> ​​
> ​​I'm a local photographer who's bored out of their mind. I'm one of those types that need to keep the ball moving in terms of creativity/new-work in order to get anything done. Essentially, I need new stuff to continue work on old stuff.
> ​​
> ​​Soooo, I'm posting here to see if there's any interest in y'all coming out to shoot free portraits of your pets in the park. (I’d eventually be down to schedule outdoor shoots individually, eventually, but seeing if I can make this format safe and workable).
> ​​
> ​​It will be totally free. I'm testing out some different proofing sites and working on logistics, scheduling, and timing for doing a bunch of individual shoots whilst maintaining safe social distancing, and not forming a large congregation.
> ​​
> ​​So the requirements would be: that your pet is: well behaved, on a leash at all times, able to sit/stay, able to wear an article of clothing (party hat, sunglasses, scarf, etc); you be within walking distance; and everyone attending to wear a mask and maintain safe social distance. Oh and you'd need to bring something for your pet to wear, Party vibes, but those cones are 👌🏼too.
> ​​
> ​​I'd be hitting different neighborhoods for different days and plan to circle back though for Party Animals I wasn't able to schedule/shoot that day.
> ​​
> ​​If anyone is interested, just reply in the comments with your nearest park. I'll be starting in Virginia Park. Dates are TBD by times of lower density.
> ​​
> ​​Walking distance is highly recommended—both for traffic reasons and in worst-case scenarios, (dead batteries or some other catastrophic failure) you just took your pet for a walk. I know this type of format highly favors dogs, but I don’t know how to do much else with the current conditions.
> ​​
> ​​You can see some of my old work here.

> ​​\[New camera since, and post-processing is similar to “paint in a new place”—it can be changed easily, try to focus on the composition/lighting.]
> ​​
> ​​Just post here if interested. Then I can work out safe timing protocols and build an intake/RSVP/scheduling system. So far it’s looking like 5 mins of shooting with 10 minutes of overlap. So ideally everyone would be 10 minutes distance apart. So max 16 slots per day based on flash battery power.
