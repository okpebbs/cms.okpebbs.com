> meta: I'm working on "curating my work." until now, I've basically been using [SmugMug](https://www.smugmug.com/) as a dumping ground for fear of not waking up in the morning. I've  lived with this "fear" since childhood. Categorically, it's not as much a fear as a plausible reality; basically, I've always accepted the fact that tomorrow may never come and try to be as well prepared to die as possible. So with my photography, I don't really care about copyrights and monetization. I just care that it's viewable and available for my subjects and anyone else to see.

I've come full circle in my workflow. I started using Adobe Camera Raw along with [ACDSee](https://www.acdsee.com/en/index/) in 2004. Since then, I've probably used/trialed every piece of photography software available. ACR has it's issues, handling variants is a pain in the ass. But it is faster and more flexible than Lightroom, due DNG/sidecar adjustment embedding. Fortunately, with the innovation of cloud storage and essentially unlimited space, my *approach* to photography is plausible.

I'm massively backlogged in terms of curation and updating old albums to the new workflow. I botched a lot of color grading the past few years with experimental workflows, and in the past few months, a poorly calibrated monitor. (That's why I've been using the tagline: *"I'm just a guy who's a photographer for fun."*)

# Then again, what the hell is *"professional photography?*"

Most of the photographers in my locale use instagram or wix for their portfolios of crazily-saturated-uncanny-valley-shit: "models" striking weird poses with glazed expressions on their poreless faces and the occasional camera-wielding-self-"portrait" of CPT. Douche/Cunt-face her/him/themselves. Not to mention the scores of dudes with: ladies as their profile photos, galleries of poorly-lit, over-processed, scantily-clad women, and a profile that says "DM for rates."

> Alas, I do not have what it takes to call myself a *"professional photographer"* in LA.

Kelly and I met on what used to be one of the greatest innovations in internet dating history: [OkCupid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OkCupid). It's one variants of OLD (online-dating) that still allows you to keep a well curated profile. I've been a user since it's inception. It *used* to be a great place to meet and make friends from all around the world. Now it's a husk of it's former glory: *"The deepest cesspool."*

I messaged Kelly with something along the lines of "Hey, I'm just looking for portrait subjects + \[discernable proof that read the entirety of her profile].

### This session is the aberrant result.

The second shutdown put me on furlough from my usual work at [NUEVA](https://nuevavenice.com/), and I was a bit hamstrung on how to go about finding subjects for PARTY_ANIMALS, due to the increase in transmission rates and the fact that the photos I was getting were not on par with my vision. While that project is *"to be continued"* at a later date, arranging these casual portrait sessions in the closest park has been, *safe* and *fun*.

I've recently just finished setting up my site *[okpebbs.com](https://okpebbs.com). Booking is finally available, it's free for first timers if you can find the "secret-link."

Maybe I'll have a ***"real portfolio"*** someday.
